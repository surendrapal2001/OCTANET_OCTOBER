This project is a vibrant travel landing page, SoulTravel, created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a bold hero section with engaging visuals, interactive travel options (hotel, flight, events, tour guide), and an intuitive search bar. The responsive layout and floating icons create an immersive experience, guiding users toward planning their next adventure.
